## Purpose üõ°
The Attack Range is a detection development platform, which solves three main challenges in detection engineering. First, the user is able to build quickly a small lab infrastructure as close as possible to a production environment. Second, the Attack Range performs attack simulation using different engines such as Atomic Red Team or Caldera in order to generate real attack data. Third, it integrates seamlessly into any Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the detection rule testing process.  

## Building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Attack Range can be built in three different ways:

- **cloud** using terraform and AWS or Azure.
- **locally** with vagrant and virtualbox see the [attack\_range\_local](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range_local/) project for details
- **serverless** see the [attack\_range\_cloud](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range_cloud/) project for details

## Installation üèó

### [AWS and Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range/wiki/AWS:-Ubuntu-18.04-Installation)

### [AWS and MacOS](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range/wiki/AWS:-MacOS-Installation)

### [Azure and MacOS](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range/wiki/Azure:-MacOS-Installation)


## Architecture üèØ
![Logical Diagram](docs/attack_range_architecture.png)

The virtualized deployment of Attack Range consists of:

- Windows Domain Controller
- Windows Server
- Windows Workstation
- A Kali Machine
- Splunk Server
- Phantom Server
- Zeek Sensor

#Installation Steps On Ubuntu/Linux machines

- Python3 

#### Logging
The following log sources are collected from the machines:

- Windows Event Logs (```index = win```)
- Sysmon Logs (```index = win```)
- Powershell Logs (```index = win```)
- Network Logs with Splunk Stream (```index = main```)
- Attack Simulation Logs from Atomic Red Team and Caldera (```index = attack```)

## Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Attack Range supports different actions:

- Configuring Attack Range
- Build Attack Range
- Perform Attack Simulation
- Test with Attack Range
- Destroy Attack Range
- Stop Attack Range
- Resume Attack Range
- Dump Log Data from Attack Range


### Build Attack Range

```
python attack_range.py show
```

### Perform Attack Simulation
- Perform Attack Simulation
```
python attack_range.py simulate -st T1003.001 -t ar-win-dc-default-Attack-Range-Key
```

### Test with Attack Range

```


### Replay Dumps into Attack Range Splunk Server
- Replay previously saved dumps from Attack Range
```
python attack_range.py replay -dn data_dump [--dump NAME_OF_DUMP]
```
- default will dump all enabled dumps described in `attack_data/dumps.yml`
- with optional argument `--dump` you can specify which dump to replay
```
python attack_range.py replay -dn data_dump --dump windows_sec_events
```
